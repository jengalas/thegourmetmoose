## INGREDIENTS
* 2-2¼ cups unbleached all-purpose flour
* 1 envelope (2¼ teaspoons) Fleishmann's yeast, not rapid rise yeast
* 2 generous tablespoons sugar
* ½ teaspoon salt
* ½ cup whole milk
* ¼ cup water
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 2 additional tablespoons butter *melted, for brushing over finished dinner rolls*



## INSTRUCTIONS
1. In a large bowl, stir together ¾ cup of the flour, the yeast, the sugar and the salt.
2. In a small saucepan, place the milk, water and butter over medium heat.  Stir until the butter is melted and mixture has reached a temperature between 120-130°F.  The best way to ensure the proper temperature is to monitor the mixture as it heats using an instant read thermometer.
3. Add the milk mixture to the flour mixture.  Using a hand-held electric mixer on medium speed, beat until mixture is smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula frequently, about 30 seconds.  Increase mixer speed to high, add another ¼ cup of the flour and beat until thoroughly incorporated.  Remove the mixer, and begin stirring in flour, in ¼ cup amounts, until a soft, manageable dough forms, about ¾ cup more flour.
4. Using the heel of your hand, begin kneading the dough, turning the bowl a quarter turn with each push down, until a smooth ball forms, continuing to sprinkle in additional flour to keep it from sticking to the sides of the bowl.  As often as I make these rolls, I always use the entire 2¼ cups of flour!
5. Cover the bowl of dough with a clean towel and allow to rest for 10 minutes. This important rest will allow the gluten in the flour to develop.
6. Uncover the dough.  If you have a kitchen scale use it. You will have 1 pound, 2-3 ounces of dough.
7. Spray an 8" round baking pan lightly with no-stick cooking spray.  Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces, about 1½ ounces each.  Between the palms of your hands, roll each piece into a ball and arrange them in the bottom of the pan as pictured (9 around the perimeter of the pan, 3 in the center).  Cover the pan with the towel and allow the rolls to rise until doubled in size, about 45-60 minutes. Preheat your oven to 350°F.
8. Bake on center rack of preheated oven until golden brown, about 18-20 minutes, and, when tapped on the top with the knuckle of your finger, they sound hollow.
9. Remove from oven and within 1 minute, invert the rolls onto a cooling rack.
10. Using a pastry brush, paint the rolls with a light coating of melted butter and allow to cool to slightly warm or room temperature.
