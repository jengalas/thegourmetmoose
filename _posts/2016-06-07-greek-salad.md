excerpt: "This is great as a side salad or for breakfast. The couscous will continue to absorb some of the dressing as it sits, so add more dressing to moisten if necessary; we prefer it on the drier side. We strongly prefer the 'Lite' version of the dressing; we found the regular to be far too oily."

## INGREDIENTS
* 10.5 ounces (½ jar) Osem Israeli couscous *sold at Wegmans*
* 2¼ cups water

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Bring water and salt to a boil, reduce heat to simmer, stir in couscous, cover for 12 minutes until all water is absorbed, stir once halfway through cooking. Drain couscous in a large strainer, run some cold water through the couscous in order to halt the cooking process, and then let chill in refrigerator while preparing the vegetables.
2. Place red onion, cucumber, scallion tops, garbanzo beans, artichoke hearts and olives in a large mixing bowl. Stir in ½ cup of the salad dressing and coat well. Gently fold in the couscous, along with the remaining dressing. Fold in the feta cheese. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Serve chilled. (Great for breakfast, too!)
