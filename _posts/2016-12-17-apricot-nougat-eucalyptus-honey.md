## INGREDIENTS
* 3 large egg whites
* ½ cup water
* ⅓ cup light corn syrup
* 2 cups granulated sugar
* 3 tablespoons granulated sugar
* ¾ cup eucalyptus honey
* 1 cup dried apricots or other dried fruit *diced*

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Place whites in the bowl of a 5-quart stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Place water, corn syrup and 2 cups sugar in a medium saucepan. Spoon honey into a second, smaller saucepan. Set both saucepans aside.
2. Whip the egg whites on medium speed for about 2 minutes, until soft peaks form. With the mixer running, slowly add remaining sugar and whip about 2 minutes, until medium peaks form. Turn off the mixer.
3. Place the pot with the honey over medium-high heat for about 2 minutes. The mixture will boil up considerably at this point. Don’t stir. Cook until the honey reaches 248°F. As soon as it reaches temperature, turn the mixer on high and add the hot honey in a slow, steady stream. Whip until stiff peaks form and then turn off the mixer.
4. Transfer the pot of water, corn syrup and sugar to the stove and cook over high heat. Boil until it reaches 290°F. Again, don’t stir. Turn the stand mixer on high and add the hot syrup in a slow, steady stream. Whip for 3 minutes.
5. Add diced apricots and stir until combined. It will be very thick. Scoop the finished nougat onto a sheet of parchment paper. Cover with a second sheet of parchment and press the nougat into an even layer about 2 inches thick. Allow to cool completely.
5. Remove parchment and cut the nougat into 1x2-inch pieces with a knife oiled with vegetable or another flavorless oil. Wipe knife down between cuts and re-oil the knife.
