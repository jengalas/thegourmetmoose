## INGREDIENTS

### Dough
* 120 grams plain yogurt
* 2 tablespoons oil
* 100 mL hot water
* 2 tablespoons sugar
* 1½ teaspoon dried yeast
* 1 teaspoon orange zest
* 350 grams plain flour

### Filling
* 120 grams butter *softened*
* 100 grams light brown sugar
* 2½ teaspoons orange zest

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Take a medium bowl, and whisk together the hot water, room temperature yogurt and oil. Set it aside for a minute. Sift the flour into a large bowl, add the dried yeast, sugar and orange zest and whisk it really well. Make a well in the centre of the flour and pour in the wet ingredients. Mix with a wooden spoon until a soft dough forms, then knead it with your hands for a couple minutes more, just to make it smooth and elastic. If the dough sticks too much, add a bit more flour if needed (a tablespoon or so). Coat the dough lightly in oil, put it back in the bowl and cover it well with plastic wrap or a large clean plastic bag, and place it in the fridge over night.
2. Next morning, when you're ready to bake, cream together the softened butter with the brown sugar and the orange zest. If the butter is soft enough, you can do this with a spatula or a wooden spoon. Take the risen dough out of the fridge and place it on a floured surface. Roll it out to a large rectangle (about 35x25 cm; 14x10") and gently spread the filling almost over the whole dough. Leave about an inch or so of room at the end of the dough, so it can stick to itself and make a good seal.
3. Roll the dough up, starting from the longer side, then use your hands to roll it and stretch it ever further. Take a very sharp knife and very carefully cut the roll into 14 even pieces. Arrange the pieces in a well-greased baking pan (35x35 cm; 14x14", or similar), cut side up. Cover them with a kitchen towel and let them rise for another 30 minutes, then bake them in a preheated oven, at 190˚C (375˚F) for 12-15 minutes. Serve them warm, straight from the oven, along with the caramel that formed on the bottom of the baking pan. Yields 14 large rolls.
