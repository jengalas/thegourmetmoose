## INGREDIENTS
* 1–1¼ lbs. round steak *about ½” thick*
* 2 large russet baking potatoes
* 2 medium yellow cooking onions
* 1 package unbaked ready-made Pillsbury pie crusts
* kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper *for seasoning*

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Preheat oven to 425°F.

2. Slice the round steak directly across the grain into 1/4” to 5/16” strips. Divide in half. Peel and slice the yellow cooking onions into 1/8” to 3/16” slices. Divide in half. Peel and slice the russet potatoes into 3/16” to 1/4” slices. Divide in half and pat the slices dry with a paper towel.

3. Unroll one pie crust and place into a 9-inch non-stick cake pan. Form it gently into the bottom and sides, and pinch a small amount of dough over and along the top edge of the pan.

4. Layer one half of the potato slices into the pan. Season with a few light sprinkles of salt. Layer half of the round steak over potatoes and season with a few sprinkles of black pepper. Add a layer of half of the yellow onions.

5. Repeat the layering process above one more time. Then top with the remaining pie crust. Pinch back the overhanging dough to make a wide crust along the top edge of the pan, at the same time joining it to the top edge of the bottom crust. With a knife cut several 1-inch long slits into top crust to allow steam to escape while baking.

6. Tear off two 2-inch wide strips of 18-inch wide aluminum foil and fold them around the edge of the crust to keep it from browning too quickly. Remove after about 25 minutes.

7. Place the pasty into the center of the oven. Bake for 50-55 minutes. If the pie crust seems to be getting too dark, lay a square of aluminum foil over the entire top during the last 10-15 minutes of baking.

8. Remove pasty from oven and allow to rest about 20 minutes or more before serving. This will allow some of the juices to be reabsorbed.

9. Leftover pasty can be covered in aluminum foil and refrigerated, and then slices can be reheated in a microwave oven.

10. Serve with ketchup, if desired.
