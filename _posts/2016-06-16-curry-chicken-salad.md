## INGREDIENTS
* 2-3 boneless chicken breasts *skin removed*
* 2 stalks celery *strings removed*
* ¼ cup fresh cilantro *chopped*
* 1 cup mayonnaise
* ½ medium onion *finely minced*
* 1 teaspoon curry powder
* 2 cloves garlic *minced*
* lettuce leaves *for serving*
* paprika *optional*

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Simmer the chicken in water (or chicken broth if you have it), then reserve for making soup later on. Do not allow the water or broth to boil.
2. Meanwhile, remove the strings from the celery and dice it into ⅓ inch dice. Wash and chop the cilantro. Peel and dice or mince the onion and garlic. Stir the curry powder, onion, and garlic into the mayonnaise, mixing well.
3. Remove the chicken from the pan using a slotted spoon. Dice into bite sized chunks. Add to the mayonnaise. Mix well.
4. Arrange a few perfect lettuce leaves in the center of a salad dish. Scoop the chicken mixture onto the center. Garnish with a sprinkle of paprika (we like to use either the Hungarian or smoked paprika) and top with a sprig of cilantro. Or serve on croissants!
