## INGREDIENTS
* 8 ounces Locatelli cheese
* 3¼ cups unbleached, all-purpose flour, plus ¼ cup additional flour for kneading, plus small amount bench flour
* 3 packets granulated active dry yeast, NOT rapid rise
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* ½ teaspoon salt
* 1½ teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper
* 1½ teaspoons white pepper
* ¼ pound salted butter (1 stick)
* 6 extra-large eggs *room temperature*
* non-stick cooking spray, or butter and flour, for preparing pans

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. If cheese is whole, chop into small pieces and then pulse in food processor to a chunky consistency, about 25 pulses. Otherwise, add grated cheese to food processor.
2. In a 2-cup measuring container, melt the butter in the microwave.  Set aside.
3. In a 1-quart measuring container, whisk the eggs together.
4. With motor running, in a thin stream, through the feed tube, add the butter, then the eggs.  A large, wet, sticky, ugly ball/mass will begin to form.
5. Using the aid of a large spoon and your hands, carefully remove the sticky dough from the processor and place it on a generously floured pastry board. Using the heel of your hand, briefly knead the dough, adding about ¼ cup of additional flour in small amounts, until dough is smooth and no longer sticks to your hands, about 1 minute.
6. Divide the dough into equal parts. Makes 2 large or medium size loaf pans, or eight mini-loaf pans. Place each one into a nonstick pan sprayed with cooking spray, or a regular loaf pan coated with butter and flour.
7. Completely cover the loaves with a kitchen towel (not a damp one) and set aside to let rise, in a warm kitchen, until they are nicely risen and have domed tops, about 2 hours. Larger loaf pans will take longer, about 2½ hours.
8. Bake loaves, all at once, on center rack of preheated 350°F oven, 18-20 minutes for mini loaf pans, 25-30 minutes for larger pans. Loaves will be honey-colored and have a hollow sound when tapped with the knuckle of your index finger.  Remove from oven and cool in pans 5-10 minutes prior to removing from pans to cool completely on a cooling rack.
