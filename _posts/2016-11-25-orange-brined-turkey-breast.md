## INGREDIENTS

### Brine
* 4 cups water
* 12 ounces frozen orange juice concentrate
* ¾ cup kosher salt
* ½ cup brown sugar
* 2 sprigs fresh rosemary
* 2 tablespoons whole black peppercorns
* 2 dried bay leaves
* 2 cloves garlic *smashed*
* 4 cups ice cubes
* 1 bone-in turkey breast *6-8 pounds*

### Glaze
* ½ cup apricot preserves
* ¼ cup fresh orange juice
* 2 tablespoons honey
* 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
* 2 teaspoons minced fresh garlic
* 2 sprigs fresh rosemary

### Additional
* 1 cup white wine or chicken broth

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. For the brine, heat water, orange juice concentrate, salt, brown sugar, 2 sprigs rosemary, peppercorns, bay leaves, and garlic in a large post over medium to a boil.
2. Cover pot and remove from heat; let cool 20 minutes. Stir in ice until melted.
3. Trim and discard excess rib and wing sections from the breast.
4. Submerge breast in brine in pot, cover, and refrigerate until ready to roast, at least 2 hours or up to overnight.
5. For the glaze, combine apricot preserves, fresh orange juice, honey, Dijon, minced garlic, and 2 sprigs rosemary in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring glaze to a boil, then remove from heat and let cool; discard rosemary sprigs.
6. Remove breast from brine, and rinse and pat dry.
7. Preheat oven to 425°F. Place a rack inside a roasting pan and coat rack with nonstick spray. Place breast skin-side up on rack and pour wine into bottom of roasting pan.
8. Roast breast 30 minutes, rotate pan, reduce temperature to 325°F, then brust breast with glaze. Roast breast until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 165°F, about 1½ hours more, brushing with glaze every 30 minutes until all glaze is used.
9. Transfer breast to a cutting board, tent with foil, and let rest 20 minutes before slicing.
