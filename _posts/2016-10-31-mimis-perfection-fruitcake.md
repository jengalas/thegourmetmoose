## INGREDIENTS
* 4 ounces lemon peel
* 4 ounces orange peel
* 4 ounces citron
* 4 ounces pineapple
* 8 ounces candied cherries
* 8 ounces dark raisins
* 8 ounces light raisins
* 1 cup chopped walnuts
* 1 cup chopped pecans
* ¼ cup flour
* 1 cup shortening
* 2 cups brown sugar
* 4 eggs
* 2¾ cups flour
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon allspice
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon
* ½ teaspoon nutmeg
* ½ teaspoon cloves
* ¾ cup grape juice

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Finely chop and mix together the peels, raisins and nuts. Sprinkle with the ¼ cup flour and mix very thoroughly.
2. Cream shortening and sugar. Add eggs and beat well. Sift together 2¾ cups flour, baking powder, salt and spices. Add alternately with the grape juice.
3. Pour batter over the fruits and mix well. Spoon into greased loaf pans (2 glass pans, 9" x 5" x 3.5") with a wax paper or parchment layer covering the bottom of the pans, filling about ¾ full. Smooth top but don't flatten.
4. Bake in 250°F oven for 3-4 hours (I bake them for 3 hours, 40 minutes). Cool completely, then remove from pan. Brush with whiskey, add apple slices on top, wrap tightly in waxed paper and foil and store in cool dark place.
