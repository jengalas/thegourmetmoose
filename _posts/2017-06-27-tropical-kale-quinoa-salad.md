## INGREDIENTS

### Salad
* 1 bunch (about 3 cups?) curly kale
* 1-1½ cups cooked quinoa *(½ cup dry made with 1 cup water)*
* ½ cup (or more) chopped mango
* ½ cup (or more) blueberries
* 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro

### Dressing
* 3 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice
* ½ teaspoon honey
* ¼ teaspoon turmeric
* ¼ teaspoon ginger (ground, fresh, or crystallized)
* salt and pepper to taste

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Remove stems from kale; tear or chop leaves and add to large bowl. Top with remaining salad ingredients and set aside.
2. Whisk together all dressing ingredients until emulsified and smooth. Pour dressing over salad and toss to combine. For best flavor, allow salad to chill for at least 30 minutes.
