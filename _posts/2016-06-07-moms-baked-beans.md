## INGREDIENTS
* One large can (32oz?) Great Northern beans
* ½ cup ketchup
* 3-4 strips of bacon *cut up*
* 3 tablespoons chopped onions
* ¼ cup packed brown sugar
* 2 teaspoons dry mustard
* black pepper to taste

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. I use the 2 quart Pyrex baking dish. Add water to come nearly to the top. Cover and bake in 275°F oven until thick, stirring every hour or so. The time is trial and error as is the taste. Other than the ketchup, I don't measure anything. You can bake them for a while one day then finish the next. They also freeze well.
