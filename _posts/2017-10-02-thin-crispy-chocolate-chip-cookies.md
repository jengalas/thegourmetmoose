## INGREDIENTS
* 7½ ounces unbleached all-purpose flour
* ¼ teaspoon salt
* ¾ teaspoon baking soda
* 8 tablespoons unsalted butter *melted and cooled*
* ½ cup granulated sugar
* ⅓ cup packed light brown sugar
* 3 tablespoons light corn syrup
* 1 large egg yolk
* 2 tablespoons milk
* 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
* ¾ cup (about 4½ ounces) semisweet chocolate chips

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375°F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside. Sift flour, salt, and baking soda onto large sheet of parchment paper; set aside.
2. In bowl of standing mixer fitted with paddle attachment, beat melted butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and corn syrup at low speed until thoroughly blended, about 1 minute. Add yolk, milk, and vanilla; mix until fully incorporated and smooth, about 1 minute, scraping bottom and sides of bowl with rubber spatula as necessary. With mixer running on low speed, fold up 3 edges of parchment around dry ingredients to form a pouch and slowly shake dry ingredients into bowl; mix on low speed until just combined, about two minutes. Do not overbeat. Add chips and mix on low speed until distributed evenly throughout batter, about 5 seconds.
3. Leaving about 2 inches between balls, scoop dough onto parchment-lined baking sheets with 1¼-inch (1 tablespoon capacity) ice cream scoop. Bake 1 sheet at a time, until cookies are deep golden brown and flat, about 12 minutes.
4. Cool cookies on baking sheet 3 minutes. Transfer cookies to wire rack and let sit until crisped and cooled to room temperature.
