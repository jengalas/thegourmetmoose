## INGREDIENTS
* 2½ cups all-purpose flour
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* ½ teaspoon salt
* ⅓ cup light brown sugar
* 2 teaspoons lime juice powder *or 2 tablespoons lime zest*
* 1 tablespoon fresh mint *finely chopped*
* 8 tablespoons unsalted butter *cold*
* ½ teaspoon lime oil
* ½-¾ cup milk *cold*

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Lightly grease a standard scone pan, or lightly grease a baking sheet; or line with parchment.
2. Combine the flour, baking powder, salt, sugar, lime juice powder or grated rind, and chopped fresh mint.
3. Work in the butter until the mixture is unevenly crumbly.
4. Add the lime oil.
5. Starting with 1/2 cup, add enough milk to make the dough cohesive. It should be evenly moist, but not so sticky that you can't work with it.
6. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, shape it into a rough ball, and roll or pat it into an 8" round.
7. Using a bench knife or sharp knife, cut the round into 8 wedges, and transfer each to the prepared pan.
8. Brush the scones with milk or cream, and sprinkle with coarse sparkling white sugar, if desired.
9. Place the pan in the freezer for 15 minutes; this will help the scones rise higher.
10. Bake the scones until they begin to brown, 18 to 24 minutes. Remove them from the oven, and transfer to a rack.
