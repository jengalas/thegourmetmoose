## INGREDIENTS
* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 1½ teaspoons baking powder
* ¼ teaspoon kosher salt
* 6 tablespoons unsalted butter *room temperature*
* ⅓ cup sugar
* 1 large egg
* 1 teaspoon lemon zest *or ¼ teaspoon lemon oil*
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* ⅓ cup whole milk
* 2-3 apricots *halved, pitted, cut into ¼-inch slices*

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Coat muffin cups with nonstick spray. Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl.
2. Using an electric mixer, beat butter and sugar in another medium bowl, occasionally scraping down sides of bowl, until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add egg, lemon zest, and vanilla and beat until combined.
3. With mixer on low speed, add dry ingredients in 3 additions alternately with milk in 2 additions, beginning and ending with dry ingredients.
4. Divide batter among muffin cups (cups will be only ⅓ full) and smooth tops. Top with apricot slices and sprinkle with raw sugar.
5. Bake until cakes are golden and a tester inserted into the centers comes out clean, 20–25 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack; let pan cool 5 minutes. Transfer cakes to rack and let cool completely.
