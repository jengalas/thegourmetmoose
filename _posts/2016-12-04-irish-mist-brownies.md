excerpt: "This recipe came from mom's old Land O Lakes cookbook from a hundred years ago (give or take a few decades). Yes, Carl, from the days when I made hand-lettered signs for the goodies on the Xmas eve table. They're rich and decadent and most people love them. I've also made a cherry version with a plain buttercream frosting (skip the peppermint extract) topped with cherry pie filling. (Almond extract might also work well in the frosting for the cherry version.)"
