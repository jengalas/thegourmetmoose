*The original recipe calls for ¼ teaspoon of nutmeg in addition to the cinnamon. We don't care for it, so I don't add it, but feel free to use it or substitute with another spice. Cardamom might work.*

## INGREDIENTS
* ½ cup sugar
* ¼ cup brown sugar *packed*
* 7+ cups sliced peaches
* pastry for double-crust pie *9 inches*
* 3 tablespoons cornstarch
* ¼ teaspoon cinnamon
* ⅛ teaspoon salt
* 2 teaspoons lemon juice
* 1 tablespoon butter

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. In a large bowl, combine sugars; add peaches and toss gently. Cover and let stand for 1 hour. Line a 9-inch pie plate with bottom pastry; trim even with edge. Set aside. Drain peaches, reserving juice.
2. In a small saucepan, combine the cornstarch, cinnamon, and salt; gradually stir in reserved juice. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Remove from the heat; stir in lemon juice and butter. Gently fold in peaches. Pour into crust.
3. Roll out remaining pastry and add to top of pie, sealing edges. Cover edges loosely with foil.
4. Bake at 400°F for about 55 minutes (54 is perfect for us) or until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly. Remove foil and cool on a wire rack.
