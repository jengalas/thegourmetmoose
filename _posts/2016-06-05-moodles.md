## INGREDIENTS
* 3 cups (390 g) all-purpose flour
* 2 eggs, lightly beaten
* water mixed with eggs, to make 1 cup
* 1 teaspoon oil

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Mix all ingredients with dough hook until combined.
2. Divide dough into two halves and wrap each half in plastic wrap. Let sit for 5 minutes.
3. Roll out one half, sprinkling liberally with flour so it doesn't stick, to desired thickness (between 1/16" - 1/8").
4. Roll dough sheet lengthwise, cut on alternating diagonals into approximately Â½" wide noodles, and separate. Spread out onto foil-lined baking sheet, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and freeze. Repeat with remaining half of dough.
5. Once the noodles are frozen, remove from the baking sheets and place into gallon-size freezer bag, and return to freezer.
