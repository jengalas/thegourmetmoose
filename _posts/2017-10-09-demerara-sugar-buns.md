## INGREDIENTS
* 1 ¼-ounce envelope active dry yeast (about 2¼ teaspoons)
* ⅔ cup whole milk *warmed*
* 3 tablespoons pure maple syrup
* 2 large eggs *room temperature*
* ¾ teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 cup whole wheat flour
* 2¾ cups all-purpose flour *plus more*
* 6 tablespoons unsalted butter *room temperature, cut into 1-inch pieces, plus melted for brushing (about 4 tablespoons)*
* ⅓ cup granulated sugar *plus more*
* 5 dried juniper berries
* ⅓ cup demerara sugar *plus more*

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Whisk yeast, milk, and maple syrup in the bowl of a stand mixer just to combine, then let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes. Whisk in eggs; add salt, whole wheat flour, 2¾ cups all-purpose flour, and 6 Tbsp. butter and mix on low speed with dough hook until a shaggy dough forms. Increase speed to medium and mix until dough comes together into a smooth ball and pulls away from the sides of bowl, 10–12 minutes.
2. Place dough in a buttered large bowl and cover. Let sit in a warm spot until doubled in size, 1–1½ hours.
3. Preheat oven to 400°F. Butter a 13x9" baking dish and sprinkle with granulated sugar, tapping out excess. If using juniper berries, finely grind in a spice mill or using a mortar and pestle. Mix ground juniper (if using), ⅓ cup demerara sugar, and ⅓ cup granulated sugar in a small bowl.
4. Punch down dough and turn out onto a lightly floured surface; divide into 3 pieces. Working with 1 piece at a time and keeping the other pieces covered in plastic wrap, roll out dough into about a 12"x8" rectangle. Sprinkle with one-third of sugar mixture and cut crosswise into 4 pieces (you should have four 8"x3" rectangles). Roll up each piece to make a long rope; squeeze ends gently and pinch along seam to seal. Tug rope to stretch so it’s about 10" long, then tie into a knot. You should end up with 12 buns.
5. Arrange buns in prepared pan to make a 4x3 grid and brush with melted butter. Sprinkle with demerara sugar and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let sit until buns look puffed and lightly hold the imprint of a finger when gently pressed, 50–70 minutes. Bake until buns are golden brown and sugar is caramelized, 15–20 minutes. Turn out of baking dish onto a wire rack and let cool slightly.
