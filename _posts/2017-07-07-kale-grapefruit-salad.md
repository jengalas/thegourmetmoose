## INGREDIENTS

### Salad
* 1 large head of kale (about 3 cups, torn?)
* ½ cup quinoa
* ½ red onion *sliced*
* ¼ cup dried cherries

### Dressing
* ½ cup extra virgin olive oil
* ¼ cup apple cider vinegar
* 1 tablespoon raw honey
* ½ tablespoon smoked paprika (or regular paprika plus a pinch of chipotle powder)
* ¼ teaspoon kosher salt
* zest of one lemon

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Cook quinoa in ¾ cup water, and let cool.
2. Make the dressing: combine dressing ingredients in liquid 2-cup measuring cup, and marinate onions for at least 30 minutes or up to a day ahead. 
3. Tear the kale into bite-sized pieces, making sure to remove the rib. Combine kale and quinoa, then sprinkle with the dried cherries. Add dressing and mix together thoroughly. Add lemon zest if desired. *Note: I found the quantity of dressing to be too much for the salad, so I strained out the onions using a slotted spoon, and then added as much of the dressing as I felt the salad needed.*
